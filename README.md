# TeDo!
A Terminal ToDo for your linux shell! Bash as our protagonist.


## Why?
Just a fun little project of mine that I came up one day when I was bored; "I really need a fast way to show me what was I supposed to do, without leaving this shell...".

So, todo was born.

Just download the one shell script 'todo' and run it. That's it.

There are things I haven't done and would like to do, e.g. checking the environment and commands, config files, handle arguments a lot better etc. But this was a quick one/two day project. So I can't bother to update it anymore. It serves its purpose.


Have fun!
